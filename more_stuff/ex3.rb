#What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
puts "
Exception handling is a computer language's support for gracefully
reporting and/or avoiding program errors due to unexpected input data
or other problems. It solves the problem of having a program quit or crash
due to these input or programming errors. A program may be able to continue
and complete all or most of its task(s) when exception handling is used.
